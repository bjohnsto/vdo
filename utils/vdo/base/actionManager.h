/**
 * ActionManager provides a generic mechanism for applying actions to
 * multi-zone entities (such as the block map or slab depot). Each action
 * manager is tied to a specific context for which it manages actions. The
 * manager ensures that only one action is active on that context at a time,
 * and supports at most one pending action. Calls to schedule an action when
 * there is already a pending action will result in VDO_COMPONENT_BUSY errors.
 * Actions may only be submitted to the action manager from a single thread
 * (which thread is determined when the action manager is constructed).
 *
 * A scheduled action consists of four components:
 *   preamble:   an optional method to be run on the initator thread before
 *               applying the action to all zones
 *   zoneAction: an optional method to be applied to each of the zones
 *   conclusion: an optional method to be run on the initiator thread once the
 *               per-zone method has been applied to all zones
 *   parent:     an optional completion to be finished once the conclusion
 *               is done
 *
 * At least one of the three methods must be provided.
